Instin is a wireless instrumentation control system based on gateways, which are in charge
of receive the instrumentation commands from the host computer, send them to the instruments
and reply the requested information (if any) to the host. This webpage contains the installation
of the system and the description of each function of :code:`instin`, the Python package that
enables the use of this wireless system from Python. It is based on the `PyVISA <https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/>`_ and
`socket <https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html>`_ Python packages.

For a complete description of this system you can read the following publications:
