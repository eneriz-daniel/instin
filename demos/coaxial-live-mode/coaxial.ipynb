    "# Open-circuit track down in a coaxial system\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo we want to spot an open-circuit in a coaxial system as the one in the figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Coaxial demo scheme](./coaxial-scheme.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The four oscilloscopes we aim to control are the Agilent DSOX1102A and the arbitrary function generator is the Tektronix AFG3252.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the oscilloscopes screen, a backwards signal is expected to appear due to the open circuit, as this means a reflection point with the following reflection coefficent:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Gamma = \\frac{Z_L - Z_0}{Z_L + Z_0}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $Z_0$ is the characteristic impedance of the wire and $Z_L$ is the load impedante at this end point, in this case $\\infty$. Thus, $\\Gamma = 1$. Additionaly, since $Z_0 = 50\\>Ω$, the resistors placed at the end of each branch avoid the emergence of other backwards signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we are measuring the time delay between the forwards and the backwards pulse in each oscilloscope and then we will find the location of the short circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you are using this code in your own system, you will have to change the VISA addresses and maybe the IPs. Also if the instrumentation is not the same the SCPI commands used here propably won`t work with yours. Try to find them in the instrument documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we need the gateways' IP and communication port and the instruments VISA addresses"
